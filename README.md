# MLOps Zoomcamp Course Project (cohorts 2023)

## Project Title: TBD

## Problem Statement:

In this MLOps zoomcamp e-course capstone project, we aim to tackle the challenge of estimating the cost for passengers taking regular taxi rides from one location to another within Washington, DC, along with nearby areas in Virginia and Maryland. Leveraging the Washington, DC taxi rides dataset, which comprises historical data from 2015 through 2019, we will build a predictive model to provide accurate fare estimates. The dataset contains comprehensive information on taxi rides that occurred within the boundaries of the DC-area. Participants can access the dataset through the provided [download link](https://opendata.dc.gov/search?categories=transportation&q=taxi&type=document%20link) and will be tasked with employing MLOps techniques and methodologies learned throughout the course to streamline the development, deployment, and monitoring of the machine learning model. By successfully addressing this problem, we can enhance the taxi service experience for both drivers and passengers while demonstrating the practical application of MLOps principles in real-world scenarios.
